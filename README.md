Smart Rail Track Sentinel - Sensor based automatic railway crossing checkpost.
	Our product is smart rail track sentinel which senses the distance of the train from the installed place and gives signals using LED lights.
	After the train leave another ultrasonic sensor senses the distance of the obstacle by sending ultrasonic sound pulses.
	When the train is 500 meters away from the check post opens.
	The main objective of our project is to avoid accidents while crossing the checkpost which has been happening in recent years. The person appointed to close the check post may not be always vigilant.
It detects with respective to distance and alerts the passers-by early. It also gives some time for crossing and to clear the related traffic.
It needs no human interference and can function accurately.
